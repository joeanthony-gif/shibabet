 1. Executive Summary
 This paper presents a new infrastructure model for sports betting—one that is 
transparent, margin-aware, and aligned with token holders, bettors, and 
ecosystem contributors. At the core of this system is a purpose-built token that 
serves as the unit of account for all bets. When a user places a bet, their tokens 
are burned. If they win, new tokens are minted to pay out their winnings. A small, 
additional amount is minted based on the margin embedded in the odds and 
distributed to liquidity providers, stakers, the protocol treasury, and incentive 
programs. The design is capital-efficient, deflationary, and transparent by default. 
Unlike traditional sportsbooks, which take directional risk and rely on internal 
balance sheets, this model does not speculate. Instead, it facilitates betting and 
redistributes the margin—fairly and programmatically—through a controlled mint 
mechanism.
 Why This Matters for Users
 2
 Tokenomic Doc
This system offers several user-facing advantages that legacy sportsbooks 
cannot:
 Deeper betting liquidity Because the platform does not rely on a fixed 
capital pool or balance sheet, it can accept high-volume bets without 
exposure constraints. Payouts are minted only when needed, allowing 
users to place large bets without limits imposed by operator risk appetite.
 Transparent and efficient pricing Odds are structured to balance the 
book, not extract maximum profit. The platform is not incentivized to “fadeˮ 
the public or manage directional risk—resulting in pricing that reflects 
actual probabilities and betting activity.
 Predictable token liquidity: While betting liquidity is uncapped, the 
platform also incentivizes token liquidity through decentralized exchanges. 
This ensures that users can enter or exit the token with minimal slippage, 
enhancing the usability of the token without destabilizing its value.
 Verifiable reward mechanics Token flows, bet outcomes, and ecosystem 
distributions are all transparent and auditable on-chain.
 Ecosystem Value
 Unlike inflation-driven token models, this system mints tokens strictly based on 
platform margin—the difference between fair odds and odds offered. Emissions 
scale with usage, not promises. A portion of every mint is also burned, ensuring 
long-term deflationary pressure as volume grows.
 To bootstrap adoption, the token is first introduced as a loyalty reward within a 
traditional sportsbook. Users accumulate tokens through normal betting activity, 
while a limited portion of the supply is offered for sale from the treasury at a 
progressively increasing price. This approach seeds the token economy with real 
users, predictable pricing and real value backing the token via the treasury—
 without speculative overhang.
 The result is a sportsbook that is:
 Transparent in odds, payouts, and token flows
 Capital-efficient and able to scale betting volume without financial risk
 3
 Tokenomic Doc
User-aligned, offering fair payouts and permissionless liquidity
 Deflationary, with supply shrinking as usage grows
 And sustainable, with every incentive rooted in real activity
 2. System Design Principles
 This betting infrastructure is built around five core principles, each reinforcing the 
systemʼs transparency, sustainability, and user alignment. These are not just 
economic guardrails — they represent a structural shift from traditional 
sportsbooks, removing capital constraints and embedding fairness and 
accountability at the protocol level.
  
 
Margin-Constrained Minting
 All token issuance is capped by the embedded margin in betting odds. The 
platform earns its margin through the spread between fair odds and those 
offered (e.g. offering 1.91 instead of 2.00 on a 50/50 market). This margin 
funds:
 Protocol rewards to stakers and liquidity providers
 Growth incentives and treasury accumulation
 Referral bonuses and user engagement
 And critically, a burn component that reinforces token scarcity
 No tokens are minted arbitrarily. Every emission must be backed by real 
user activity and platform edge.
 Burn-on-Bet, Mint-on-Win
 Tokens are burned at the time of betting, regardless of outcome. If the user 
loses, the tokens remain permanently removed from circulation. If the user 
wins, tokens are minted to cover their full payout, along with a small 
amount of additional tokens distributed to the ecosystem.
 This structure has two major benefits:
 4
 Tokenomic Doc
 
The platform operates without a balance sheet, enabling uncapped 
betting volume
 Users face no payout risk — rewards are minted programmatically 
and immediately, independent of treasury balances or capital 
buffers
 Liability risk minimization
 Unlike traditional sportsbooks that take directional positions or tolerate 
skewed exposure based on sentiment, this platform seeks to balance total 
liability across outcomes.
 By aiming to keep expected payouts relatively even regardless of outcome, 
the system minimizes spikes in minting or burning — ensuring smoother 
token flow, more consistent deflation, and predictable economic dynamics. 
As a result, the odds offered may differ from traditional operators, 
reflecting a desire for balance rather than speculative edge-taking whilst 
also providing a point of differentiation from the majority of sportsbooks 
that rely on only a handful of data providers.
  
 
Tokenomic Doc
 Token supply reduction systematically tied to platform usage
 The more users bet, the more tokens are burned — either directly (via 
losing bets) or indirectly (via the burned portion of mint emissions). 
Although winners receive freshly minted tokens, the system ensures that 
over time, total supply trends downward as long as the embedded margin 
exceeds the token issuance tied to it.
 This makes the token model fundamentally different from inflationary 
ecosystems. Here, usage and deflation scale together, aligning long-term 
token value with real platform engagement.
 Transparency by Default
 All minting, burning, and reward distributions are verifiable on-chain. Even 
in a custodial user experience, every wallet is tied to an address, and every 
event is traceable.
 Anyone — users, auditors, community members — can confirm:
 How much has been bet
 5
How much has been minted
 How rewards are allocated across the ecosystem
 This removes the need for trust in the operator and reinforces a core 
promise of the platform: fair odds, transparent outcomes, and sustainable 
mechanics.
 3. Tokenized Betting: Core Mechanics
 The platform uses a single native token as the currency for all bets. Each user is 
assigned or connects a dedicated wallet, and all token flows — including bet 
burns, payouts, and rewards — occur through this wallet and are executed on
chain. While the bet logic itself (e.g. determining winners, resolving outcomes) is 
handled off-chain for performance, each bet is recorded on-chain in a 
lightweight, transparent format. This ensures that every bet can be publicly 
verified, without sacrificing speed or user experience.
 Bet Lifecycle
  User places a bet
 Tokens are immediately burned from the userʼs wallet
 The platform emits an on-chain event containing key bet metadata:
 Market ID (e.g. 
"EPL2025MANLIV001" )
 Market type (e.g. 
"Match Winner" )
 Outcome selected (e.g. 
Stake amount
 Odds offered
 Timestamp
  Outcome is resolved off-chain
 "Team A wins" )
 A trusted oracle verifies the event result

 Tokenomic Doc
The platform determines whether the user won or lost
  Settlement
 If the user loses: no mint occurs
 If the user wins: tokens are minted to pay the full winnings
 A small, additional mint based on platform margin is distributed to the 
ecosystem, with a portion burned again to ensure deflationary 
pressure.
 All token movements — including burns, payouts, and reward distributions — 
are visible on-chain, and tied to the userʼs wallet.
 Worked Example
 Inputs:
 Bet: 100 tokens
 Odds offered: 1.91
 Fair odds: 2.00
 Margin: 9 tokens
 If the user loses
 100 tokens burned
 No mint occurs
 → Net supply change = 100 tokens
 If the user wins
 191 tokens minted for payout

 Because each outcome in this case has a 50% chance of occurring, the 
burned component of the margin drives deflationary pressures over time.
 If user loses
 If user wins
 Net
 100 burned
 97.3 minted
 2.7 removed
 Variance and Deflation Over Time
 While winning bets increase token supply, the system is designed to be 
deflationary in aggregate:
 Losing bets burn 100% of their stake
 Winning bets mint the required payout plus a capped margin, a portion of 
which is burned
 As long as the embedded margin is greater than the reward emissions, 
net deflation occurs over time
 However, this does not happen on every bet. There is natural variance. If too 
many users win a specific market, minting may temporarily exceed burning. To 
manage this, the platform focuses on balancing liability across outcomes. By 
encouraging even expected payouts, the system minimizes spikes in minting or 
burning. This smooths token dynamics and strengthens the long-term 
deflationary curve.
 Transparency Without Friction
 As mentioned, when a user places a bet the platform emits an on-chain event 
containing key bet metadata. The lightweight on-chain bet log ensures:
 Tokenomic Doc
 8
Every bet is publicly recorded and tied to a wallet
 Stake amounts, odds, and markets are auditable
 Token flow remains fully transparent without adding friction to the betting 
process
 Future versions may build on this by introducing NFT bet receipts or full on
chain bet state for additional composability, user engagement, or gamification.
 4. Margin-Based Minting Model
 The platformʼs token economy is powered entirely by its embedded margin—the 
difference between the true (or “fairˮ) odds and the odds offered to users. Unlike 
fixed-reward models that emit tokens on a schedule or per transaction, this 
system is designed to mint only what is economically justified by platform 
activity.
 This ensures that token emissions are:
 Proportional to actual usage
 Bounded by real margin revenue
 Flexible across different market conditions
 And sustainable over the long term
 How It Works
 Every time a user wins a bet, the system must mint tokens to pay their winnings. In 
addition to that, a small amount of tokens—equal to the platformʼs house margin—
 is minted and distributed to various stakeholders which also incorporates a burn 
component.
 This margin is calculated as:
 Margin = Fair Odds  Offered Odds)  Stake
 That margin determines the maximum clip available to be minted for the 
ecosystem. This means:
 9
 Tokenomic Doc
Rewards never exceed what the platform has earned
 The system can adapt to both low-margin and high-margin markets
 Emissions scale with volume, not time
 Example A: High-Margin Market
 Parameters:
 Fair odds: 2.00
 Offered odds: 1.91
 Stake: 100 tokens
 Margin: 9 tokens
 Mint Distribution (on a winning bet):
 191 tokens minted to pay the winner
 9 tokens minted from margin
 30% of the margin clip is burned 2.7 tokens)
 Net effect:
 100 tokens burned on bet
 200 tokens minted
 2.7 tokens immediately re-burned
  The net supply expands by 97.3 tokens in this instance, but long-term 
deflation is preserved as losing bets accumulate and margin-driven emissions 
remain capped.
 Example B: Low-Margin Market
 Parameters:
 Fair odds: 2.00
 Offered odds: 1.98
 10
 Tokenomic Doc
Stake: 100 tokens
 Margin: 2 tokens
 Mint Distribution (on a winning bet):
 198 tokens minted to pay the winner
 2 tokens minted from margin
 0.6 tokens burned 30% of margin)
 Net effect:
 Supply impact is smaller due to lower margin
 Burn component scales with margin
  Rewards are lower, but aligned with the reduced platform take. The system 
remains price competitive and sustainable, even in tight-margin events.
 Why This Model Matters
 This structure creates a range of important benefits:
 Scalable: Works across niche high-margin markets and competitive low
margin ones like NBA.
 Efficient: Token emissions are tightly coupled to platform profitability
 Deflationary by design: As long as margin > reward clip and most users 
lose (as is statistically expected with a margin), the system reduces net 
supply
 Incentive-aligned: Participants earn more only when the platform earns 
more
 In traditional token models, maintaining staking rewards or LP incentives in low
margin environments often requires subsidies or artificial inflation. Here, no such 
external subsidy is needed. The system balances itself organically, with 
emissions directly reflecting the margin environment.
 11
 Tokenomic Doc
5. Deflationary Supply Dynamics
 While the token system is designed to expand as needed to pay winners, it 
structurally trends toward net supply reduction as betting volume increases and 
margin is realized. This supply tightening creates meaningful value capture for 
long-term token holders and ecosystem participants.
 Deflation as Value Distribution
 In this model a portion of the house edge is burned, reinforcing the systemʼs 
deflationary bias.
 Over time, this means that:
 More tokens are burned than minted, as betting volume drives deflation.
 thus the token supply contracts, even as usage scales
 This creates a value loop where holding the token becomes more attractive
 Importantly, deflation doesnʼt just benefit the system — it benefits every token 
holder. As supply tightens and usage grows:
 Token scarcity increases
 Value is captured by the ecosystem rather than extracted by the operator
 Users who hold tokens (e.g. stakers, LPs, bettors who win and retain 
rewards) are proportionally rewarded
 In effect, users collectively earn a portion of the house edge — simply by 
participating in a system designed to grow leaner as it grows larger.
 Summary
 Deflation is an output of economic design, not an artificial cap
 It serves as a mechanism for protocol-level value sharing
 As betting volume grows, token supply tightens, and token holders benefit
 This model aligns the interests of the platform, its users, and the token 
economy — making the token not just functional, but fundamentally 
valuable
 12
 Tokenomic Doc
6. Wallet Architecture & Transparency
 A cornerstone of the platformʼs integrity is its commitment to transparent token 
flow and user-level accountability. Every user account is tied to a wallet, and all 
token movements — including bets, burns, payouts, rewards, and staking — are 
executed through that wallet on-chain.
 This structure enables:
 Public verification of user activity
 Consistent attribution of rewards and leaderboard rankings
 Optional user self-custody, without compromising usability
 Custodial by Default, Linkable by Design
 To streamline onboarding, wallets are custodial by default — created and 
managed by the platform on behalf of each user. This ensures:
 Gas is handled behind the scenes
 UX remains frictionless (no wallet pop-ups or failed transactions)
 Token transactions still occur on-chain, tied to the user's wallet
 Advanced users may optionally link their own external wallet at any time. Once 
linked:
 Rewards can be withdrawn directly
 Staking and governance (if introduced) can be managed autonomously
 All on-chain activity remains verifiable by third parties
 Each wallet, whether platform-created or user-linked, serves as the anchor for 
transparency.
 On-Chain Bet Logging
 While bet logic is resolved off-chain, each bet is recorded on-chain via an event, 
which includes:
 13
 Tokenomic Doc
Market ID
 Selected outcome
 Stake amount
 Odds offered
 Timestamp
 Wallet address
 These event logs are:
 Publicly auditable
 Indexed for leaderboards, analytics, and history
 Lightweight (no stored state), minimizing gas costs
 This allows the platform to retain high-speed resolution and settlement, while 
giving users and observers full visibility into the betting ecosystem.
 Fair Attribution and Abuse Prevention
 With a 11 relationship between users and wallets, the system can:
 Track cumulative betting activity
 Attribute rewards (like staking multipliers or referral bonuses) accurately
 Prevent abuse (e.g. creating multiple wallets to farm incentives)
 If users change wallets, the system maintains a record of historical associations, 
so full betting history and attribution remain intact.
 Leaderboards and Trust Layers
 This wallet-based architecture supports features like:
 Monthly betting competitions
 Volume or burn-based rankings
 Gamified referral programs
 Reputation systems for high-skill or high-volume users
 14
 Tokenomic Doc
All of this is built on-chain — no need for trust, no hidden data, and no reliance on 
opaque internal databases.
 7. Treasury, Staking, and Liquidity 
Incentives
 The House edge that is minted alongside winning bets is not taken by the operator 
but instead, it is distributed across the ecosystem to incentivize usage, deepen 
liquidity, and reward participation — with a portion burned to reinforce deflation.
 The distribution is defined as a percentage of the platformʼs embedded margin, 
ensuring that emissions are directly tied to platform activity and aligned with its 
economic output.
 Standard Distribution Breakdown
 Recipient
 % of Margin Mint
 Burned
 Treasury
 30%
 30%
 Liquidity Providers 30%
 Stakers
 10%
 These percentages reflect a balanced starting point — but they are not fixed 
indefinitely.
 Dynamic Allocation Through Governance
 As the platform matures, market conditions will shift:
 Liquidity on exchanges may deepen to the point where additional LP 
incentives become inconsequential.
 The treasury may grow large enough to cover multi-year operations
 Burn levels may need to be adjusted to accelerate deflation
 15
 Tokenomic Doc
To respond to these changes, the system may introduce governance-driven 
allocation adjustments, allowing token holders to vote on redistributing the 
margin mint across these categories.
 For example:
 Reducing LP incentives if liquidity is abundant
 Redirecting emissions toward burn or staking
 Temporarily increasing growth incentives during a user acquisition push
 Capping treasury allocation if funding is already sufficient
 This allows the system to remain responsive without undermining its core 
constraints:
 All emissions are still margin-bound
 No arbitrary inflation is introduced
 The incentive model remains tightly coupled to usage
 Incentive Components (Initial)
  Treasury 30%
 Supports protocol development, marketing, partnerships, and reserve capital.
  Liquidity Providers 30%
 Rewards those who make it easy for users to buy/sell the token without 
slippage.
  Stakers 10%
 Provides yield to long-term holders who help reduce circulating supply.
  Burn 30%
 Permanently removes supply, ensuring long-term deflation and value capture.
 This dynamic structure gives the system a robust foundation — with the flexibility 
to evolve intelligently, guided by the same community that benefits from its 
success.

 Tokenomic Doc
8. Bootstrapping: Loyalty Distribution and 
Treasury Sale
 Launching a token ecosystem requires careful sequencing to build utility, demand, 
and sustainability. This platformʼs bootstrapping model uses an incremental 
rollout, grounded in real usage and aligned with long-term value creation — with 
betting as the first utility, not the final stage.
 Phase 1: Token as Loyalty Incentive (Traditional 
Betting Model)
 Initially, users bet on the existing sportsbook. In parallel, they begin earning 
“pointsˮ as a loyalty reward, based on their activity.
 Points are distributed based on betting volume and other incentive 
mechanisms like referalls.
 They are accumulated on the users account over time.
 Initially, the points cannot yet be bought or sold, but can be accumulated 
and tracked
 Points will convert to tokens and be visible on-chain via the users linked 
wallet and the end of phase 1.
 This stage allows users to:
 Familiarize themselves with the token
 Accumulate future utility without risk
 Become stakeholders in the upcoming ecosystem shift
 Phase 2: Betting in the Token Begins
 Once a sufficient user base has accumulated tokens, the platform will enable 
betting in the token directly, even if liquidity is not yet deep on exchanges.
 Users can place bets using the token
 The systemʼs burn-on-bet, mint-on-win mechanics activate
 Margin-based rewards begin flowing to the ecosystem.
 17
 Tokenomic Doc
Initially rewards may accumulate for a period of time to maximize 
incentives on launch (future details will be provided)
 This activity kickstarts the token economy and creates the core value loop
 In this model, betting comes before liquidity — because it is betting that gives the 
token its value. This approach prioritizes usage over speculation and allows for an 
accelerated rewards profile as the platform grows in itʼs initial usage.
 Phase 3: Staking, LP Incentives, and Treasury Sale
 With token betting active and usage growing, the platform introduces additional 
layers to deepen the economy:
 Staking Users can lock tokens to earn a portion of margin rewards
 Liquidity Provision Incentives are introduced for LPs on decentralized 
exchanges
 Treasury Sale A controlled portion of the total supply is sold at a gradually 
increasing price, providing:
 Early price discovery
 Initial liquidity
 Treasury funding for long-term growth
 The treasury sale is finite. Once complete, all tokens in circulation must be either 
earned (via betting or staking) or purchased from other users.
 Why This Sequencing Works
 Utility-first Token use begins with betting, not speculation
 Deflation engine activated early Burns begin before emissions scale
 Liquidity grows with demand LPs are incentivized only once thereʼs 
betting volume
 Avoids circular speculation Value is tied to economic flow, not emissions
 By prioritizing real usage from day one, the system builds a healthier foundation 
for both token value and user engagement.

9. Risk Management Reimagined: 
Balancing Liability in a Token-Based 
Sportsbook
 In traditional sportsbooks, risk management is centered on capital. Operators take 
directional exposure, manage reserves, and shape odds based on sentiment and 
expected bettor behavior. Profitability often hinges on predicting user mistakes 
and exploiting public biases.
 This platform adopts a fundamentally different approach — one that eliminates 
operator risk and instead builds risk management into the protocol itself.
 From Capital Exposure to Protocol-Based Logic
 The system does not maintain a balance sheet, nor does it need to. Instead:
 All bets are burned immediately at the time of placement
 Payouts are minted on winning outcomes
 Margin-based emissions fund rewards and incentives
 User funds connect directly to a wallet, and no treasury is needed to cover 
outcomes
 This architecture means the platform takes no directional risk, and payouts are 
programmatic. As long as the system retains an edge via embedded margin, it 
can scale indefinitely without increasing operational exposure.
 Liability Balancing
 What matters in this model is not how many users bet on each side, but how much 
liability each side represents.
 The platform dynamically adjusts odds to maintain balanced expected payouts 
across all outcomes:
 19
 Tokenomic Doc
If one outcome accumulates significantly more liability than the other(s), odds 
are shifted to incentivize new bets that help rebalance the book
 This is done not to “hedgeˮ risk, but to minimize unpredictable minting spikes
 Importantly, total bet volume can be highly uneven, but if the odds properly 
reflect it, liability can remain balanced
 By focusing on liability rather than sentiment or positioning, the platform maintains 
stable margin capture and avoids the sharp supply volatility that might otherwise 
occur if one side of a market wins disproportionately.
 Protocol-Level Risk Benefits
  Uncapped Scalability
 The platform can process large volumes of betting without additional reserves 
or hedging structures. Payouts are minted only when owed.
  Predictable Token Flows
 By balancing liability, the system reduces variance in minting and deflation. 
Token supply becomes smoother and easier to forecast over time.
  User-Aligned Economics
 The protocol doesnʼt profit from user losses. It profits from usage — and the 
more balanced the book, the more consistent the margin realization.
  Incentive Consistency
 Odds exist to manage liability, not to “trapˮ bettors. This reduces adversarial 
dynamics and builds long-term trust with users.
 Residual Risk and Ecosystem Distribution
 While operator-level risk is eliminated, economic variance still exists:
 One-sided outcomes can still result in temporary supply expansions
 Over time, this is offset by consistent margin capture and burn mechanics
 Staking and liquidity incentives are structured to distribute risk and reward 
across the ecosystem — reinforcing alignment among bettors, token holders, 
20
 Tokenomic Doc
and protocol participants
 In this model, risk doesnʼt disappear — it is simply reengineered into the protocol 
layer, where it becomes manageable, auditable, and predictable.
 10. Ecosystem Utility: A Hedging Layer for 
the Broader Gambling Industry
 While this platform is designed to operate as a self-contained sportsbook, its 
structure offers a much broader utility: it can act as a transparent, decentralized 
risk settlement layer for the wider gambling ecosystem.
 As the token economy matures and liquidity deepens, the protocol can be used by 
other sportsbooks and operators to hedge their exposure — without relying on 
traditional counterparties or OTC arrangements.
 The Problem with Traditional Risk Sharing
 In the current gambling industry:
 Smaller sportsbooks or new operators often face exposure limits
 Hedging is done through partnerships, intermediaries, or inefficient 
exchanges
 Counterparty risk, pricing opacity, and delays make it difficult to scale 
effectively
 These problems are especially acute during high-stakes or emotionally driven 
events, where one-sided betting behavior creates significant risk.
 The Protocol as a Risk Management Tool
 This system offers a solution:
 Liquidity is available programmatically, not through manual negotiation
 Odds reflect real-time market pressure, driven by liability balancing
 21
 Tokenomic Doc
Settlement is automated, verifiable, and on-chain
 No counterparty risk — all minting and payouts are governed by protocol 
logic
 An external sportsbook could:
 Mirror their users' risk profile by placing bets into this system
 Offset exposure without capital lockups
 Protect themselves during periods of imbalance, large events, or 
promotional campaigns
 Stronger Industry, Not Just a Stronger Protocol
 By offering a neutral, scalable, and transparent risk sink, this protocol doesnʼt 
compete with other sportsbooks — it strengthens the entire industry.
 New operators can launch with less capital
 Existing books can absorb more volume with less risk
 Market efficiency improves as edge-taking is replaced by real-time 
hedging
 As liquidity increases and adoption grows, the protocol can become a core 
infrastructure layer for managing risk across the gambling sector — not just a 
new way to bet, but a new way to stay solvent.
 11. Deep Liquidity as Economic 
Infrastructure
 As the ecosystem matures, liquidity on decentralized exchanges will naturally 
deepen — driven by protocol incentives, treasury support, and increased user 
participation. While this begins as a user experience improvement, it ultimately 
evolves into a core strength of the system's financial architecture.
 Price Stability Through Depth
 22
 Tokenomic Doc
In the early stages of a token economy, price can be volatile due to thin liquidity 
and small order books. This creates friction for users:
 Difficulty entering/exiting positions
 High slippage on conversions
 Value erosion when withdrawing winnings or reallocating capital
 But as trading depth increases:
 The token price becomes more stable and less reactive to single trades
 Users can transact in size without affecting price
 The platform becomes economically insulated from broader market 
volatility, especially if the token is primarily driven by platform usage rather 
than speculation
 This transforms the token from a volatile utility asset into a functional, resilient 
medium of exchange within the ecosystem.
 Liquidity as Access Layer
 Deep liquidity also unlocks utility for every participant in the ecosystem:
 Bettors can convert into and out of the token easily, with minimal friction
 Stakers benefit from a more stable value base and reduced risk of 
volatility-based drawdowns
 Liquidity providers earn consistent rewards in a predictable market
 External sportsbooks can hedge into the protocol with confidence that 
entry/exit wonʼt distort their own risk model
 Over time, this creates an economic flywheel:
  More users = more bets
  More margin = more emissions
  More rewards = more LPs
  More liquidity = better pricing and stability
  Better stability = more trust, higher volume, and potential institutional usage
 23
 Tokenomic Doc
Decentralized, Yet Predictable
 Deep liquidity allows the token to function as a stable, purpose-driven economic 
unit, even in a volatile market. This doesn't mean the price is pegged or artificially 
constrained — it means:
 Its value is anchored by usage
 Volatility is reduced by liquidity depth
 The user experience improves as the system scales
 This is how the protocol can grow into a real alternative to traditional betting rails 
— one with trustless execution, transparent economics, and institutional-grade 
infrastructure.
 12. Optional Enhancements and Roadmap 
Extensions
 The core platform design is intentionally simple and robust — prioritizing 
transparency, fairness, and scalability from day one. However, the architecture 
also supports a wide range of future enhancements that can deepen user 
engagement, improve transparency, and unlock new value streams.
 These extensions are not required for the system to function, but they offer 
exciting pathways for growth as the ecosystem matures.
 1. On-Chain Bet Recording via NFTs
 Each bet could optionally be minted as a non-fungible token NFT that serves as:
 A receipt of the bet
 A proof-of-prediction artifact
 A potential collectible or reputational badge
 Winning NFTs could be redeemable for payouts, while losing NFTs could remain 
as part of a transparent, verifiable betting history. This could unlock:
 Bet history leaderboards
 24
 Tokenomic Doc
Seasonal competitions (e.g. “Top 100 bettorsˮ)
 Tradable markets for rare or historic bets
 2. Leaderboards and Gamified Mechanics
 Using wallet-linked data, the system can introduce:
 Burn-based rewards (“Top 10 token burnersˮ)
 Volume-based competitions (“Most betting volume in a monthˮ)
 Community challenges and prediction leagues
 Streak rewards for win consistency or bold bets
 These programs can be built directly on top of existing bet logs and token flow — 
no need for separate infrastructure.
 3. Progressive Staking or Lock-Up Multipliers
 Staking could evolve to include:
 Tiered reward structures based on time commitments
 Loyalty multipliers for consistent stakers
 Reputation layers tied to betting behavior or ecosystem contributions
 This would deepen alignment with the protocol and give users additional ways to 
benefit beyond just LP provision or casual holding.
 4. Multi-Protocol Integration for Hedging and Access
 As adoption increases, the platform could offer:
 SDKs or APIs for third-party sportsbooks to connect and hedge into the 
protocol
 Integration with existing prediction markets
 Cross-chain exposure through bridges or wrapped versions of the token
 This would extend the systemʼs role as a neutral betting settlement layer for the 
industry at large.

5. Governance Evolution
 Over time, governance could expand to include:
 Allocation adjustments (as discussed in Section 7
 Treasury disbursements and ecosystem grants
 Risk parameters and reward tuning
 Long-term protocol development decisions
 This creates a path toward user-directed evolution, ensuring the system remains 
responsive without becoming unstable.
 6. Visual and Social Layers
 To complement the technical infrastructure, the platform could also develop:
 Public dashboards for on-chain bet history and protocol stats
 Shareable win/loss records or NFT-based trophies
 Interfaces for public predictions, social wagering, or community-curated 
markets
 These layers would enhance visibility, onboarding, and brand identity — helping 
the protocol evolve into a destination, not just a backend.
 With a clear foundation and extensible architecture, this system can start simple, 
grow organically, and evolve into something truly transformative for both users 
and the broader industry.
 7. Programmatic On-Chain Referrals
 A native on-chain referral system can be introduced to scale user acquisition in a 
transparent, automated way. Unlike traditional referral programs that rely on trust 
and manual oversight, on-chain referrals are:
 Immutable and fraud-resistant
 Self-verifying, with referral codes or wallet relationships tied directly to 
contract interactions
 Scalable, with no overhead per new user or region

This unlocks powerful growth mechanics:
 Users receive a share of margin rewards generated by referees
 Multi-level referral structures (with caps) can be encoded if desired
 Leaderboards and time-based campaigns can be layered on top (e.g. “Top 
referrers this quarterˮ)
 Treasury funds can be allocated dynamically to high-performing referral 
cohorts via governance
 By embedding referral logic directly into the protocol, the system can grow virally, 
without sacrificing sustainability or transparency.
 13. Closing Summary: A Better Betting 
Economy, By Design
 This protocol isnʼt just a sportsbook — itʼs a full economic system, designed from 
first principles to align incentives, eliminate risk, and scale transparently.
 It reimagines what a betting platform can be:
 No balance sheet exposure
 No hidden odds manipulation
 No extractive token inflation
 Instead, it offers:
 Burn-on-bet, mint-on-win mechanics that align reward with actual 
platform margin
 A deflationary token model that rewards usage, not speculation
 Deep liquidity incentives and programmatic staking that reinforce long
term alignment
 A structure that allows other sportsbooks to hedge, creating a 
decentralized backbone for risk distribution across the industry

From its early phase as a loyalty program to full token-based betting, staking, and 
treasury distribution — the platform prioritizes utility and sustainability over hype. 
It grows not through promises, but through usage.
 With a robust core and a roadmap of modular enhancements — from NFT bet 
receipts and leaderboards to automated referrals and DAO-driven treasury control 
— this system is built to evolve.
 It offers users a fairer experience.
 It offers token holders real value capture.
 And it offers the industry a safer, smarter way to manage risk at scale.
 This is not just a better sportsbook — itʼs a new foundation for betting.
